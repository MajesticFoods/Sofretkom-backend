### Project Name: Sofretkom

1. Our idea is to make a SPA that displays recipes based on what the user searches for, and lists all recipes containing that word.

 

2. The main problem that this idea solves, is that without going and searching for recipes in all places, this SPA will gather all recipes and display them directly.

 

3. Our MVP is to get the webpage up and running where recipes can be called upon using a word in the search field, and all recipes with applicable keyword will display on the webpage.
