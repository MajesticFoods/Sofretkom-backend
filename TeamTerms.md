Project Name: Sofretkom
Our idea is to make a SPA that displays recipes based on what the user searches for, and lists all recipes containing that word.

The main problem that this idea solves, is that without going and searching for recipes in all places, this SPA will gather all recipes and display them directly.

Our MVP is to get the webpage up and running where recipes can be called upon using a word in the search field, and all recipes with applicable keyword will display on the webpage.

# Group Project: Team Agreement

### Cooperation Plan
#### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
Each and every member is a valuable asset in our team. Each member has a background in programming that we encountered during our course in 301. We want to help each other gain new experience and enhance our skills in creating a full cred app (Using frontend, backend connected to an API).

#### How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
We will combine our skills and strengths to complete a 

### Conflict Plan
#### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
Respect is a number one priority in our team. Any transgress towards respect of any member will be dealt with immediately, and raised to the instructor for further investigation. If any member takes over and not allow the other members to contribute, we will discuss it with him / her and make sure that everyone contributes to the task / project.

#### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
On the contrary, for members who will not contribute, we will address him with the issue and explain to him that he can't take credit for others' work, and should contribute with what he is able to. If any of the conflict resolutions are not successful, we will have to address the issue to the instructor so that they can take adequate measures.

#### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
We will try to help and explain any concept that is difficult for other members.

#### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
For any member that will not adequately contribute, we will approach the member and address the issue, if he/she will still not contribute, we will address the instructor so that the issue can be dealt with.

#### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
If any resolution attempts are unsuccessful, we will escalate it tot the instructor.

#### What hours will you be available to communicate?
We will be available to communicate every weekday, from 11:00AM to 5:00PM.

We might be also working on weekends, if that happens we will be announcing it on our slack channel beforehand. Mainly we will be using Slack for our communications.

#### How often will you take breaks?
Every hour we will take a 10 minute break, and will have short breaks for prayers. On the weekends, Slack app will be used to communicate. Everyone's voice and concerns will be heared, each day we will ask all team members to address the team leader with any concerns or matters.

#### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
Any matter or concern addressed will not be judged, it will be taken into consideration and dealt with immediately. For that, all members will feel safe to work and raise any concerns.

### Work Plan

#### How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
Each assignment will be broken down into smaller tasks and posted to Trello. Each task will be identified on the hierarchy of importance. Each task will be dragged to the progress tab, and marked off when completed. After each card completed, we will be merging the PR on Github, where 1 or more team member will review before committing the merge. The team member who reviewed can merge the PR, after informing all team members that he is about to merge, to prevent conflicts on Github. Each member working on an assignment must work on a sepearte branch other than the main, so that in case of any errors or conflicts we can revert back to the previous version.

Trello.

All components will be live except for the environement variables.

Any member that all team members agree to merge.

#### How often will you merge?
We will merge after each branch.

On Zoom, we will agree that it's time to merge.
