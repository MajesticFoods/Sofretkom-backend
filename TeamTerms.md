# Group Project: Team Agreement

### Cooperation Plan

Each and every member is a valuable asset in our team. Each member has a background in programming that we encountered during our course in 301. We want to help each other gain new experience and enhance our skills in creating a full cred app (Using frontend, backend connected to an API).

### Conflict Plan

Respect is a number one priority in our team. Any transgress towards respect of any member will be dealt with immediately, and raised to the instructor for further investigation. If any member takes over and not allow the other members to contribute, we will discuss it with him / her and make sure that everyone contributes to the task / project.
On the contrary, for members who will not contribute, we will address him with the issue and explain to him that he can't take credit for others' work, and should contribute with what he is able to. If any of the conflict resolutions are not successful, we will have to address the issue to the instructor so that they can take adequate measures.

### Communication Plan

We will be available to communicate every weekday, from 11:00AM to 5:00PM. We might be also working on weekends, if that happens we will be announcing it on our slack channel beforehand. Mainly we will be using Slack for our communications. Every hour we will take a 10 minute break, and will have short breaks for prayers. On the weekends, Slack app will be used to communicate. Everyone's voice and concerns will be heared, each day we will ask all team members to address the team leader with any concerns or matters.
Any matter or concern addressed will not be judged, it will be taken into consideration and dealt with immediately. For that, all members will feel safe to work and raise any concerns.

### Work Plan

Each assignment will be broken down into smaller tasks and posted to Trello. Each task will be identified on the hierarchy of importance. Each task will be dragged to the progress tab, and marked off when completed. After each card completed, we will be merging the PR on Github, where 1 or more team member will review before committing the merge. The team member who reviewed can merge the PR, after informing all team members that he is about to merge, to prevent conflicts on Github. Each member working on an assignment must work on a sepearte branch other than the main, so that in case of any errors or conflicts we can revert back to the previous version.
